# Input
The program takes in a text input from the user. Specifically, the user is asked to input their favorite course from a list of available courses.

# Process
The user’s input is processed by updating the `favoriteCourse` state in the app using the React `useState` hook. The input is captured through a text field and stored.

# Output
The program outputs the user’s favorite course in a text area below the input field, dynamically updating as the user types.
